What I have learned watching the video about the SEARC ENGINES is really a huge backround work. As a user I never thought about how many types of searching options are. In the video I learned that Search Engines use programs to categorise the content on a web page through keywords. Search results are ranked based on a number of factors. It is very important how is organised data, they use algorithms. Each query get a fast answer becouse is directed to the closest data centre.
I learned a lot of new information from this video, I mentioned here the most interesting ones here.
I am open to learn more and more in this domain
