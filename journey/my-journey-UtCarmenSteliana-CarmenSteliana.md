My experience as a QC Data Reviewer in the pharmaceutical industry, along with my enthusiasm for technology, fueled my desire to delve deeper into the processes of evaluating and verifying software products and applications. 
The first steps I took in this direction was to take the Introductory Course at the School Informal of IT where I acquired knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript (my personal projects are on my GitHub profile) and then to obtain the ISTQBÂ® Certified Tester Foundation Level certification. 
Currently, I am impatient and excited to join the peviitor.ro project in order to continue to develop and be a good tester day by day.
