As a certified QA tester, my main focus is to develop a carrer in Software Testing.
I am very grateful to be part of this project, as my intention is to develop new skills in QA automation. Laurentiu BALUTA is the person I report my activity and hopefully I will soon start learning Java under his supervision. In his team, I create issues in GitHUB, also I colaborate with other team members to create test cases, or to prepare test documentation. Currently, I started doing testing on the scrapers conducted by David Mondoc and Alexandra Anghelut.
My objective is to extend my QA knowledge and also to develop new technical skills.
I would like to prepare myself to take the ISTQB exam, as I just completed a course on Udemy that helped me prepare fot this certification.
On the other hand, I would like to be more active in this project and practise my interpersonal skills, also improve my analytical mindset.
I am truely grateful to Sebastian Boga, who has put an extensive effort in the project called PE VIITOR and has always acted as a true mentor, a guide even for beginners.
