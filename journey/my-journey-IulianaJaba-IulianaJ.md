Greetings!  👋🏻

I am an enthusiastic Frontend Developer who embarked on this journey driven by the desire to integrate technical expertise with creativity, crafting innovative ideas and developing practical solutions.

Through my previous adventures, I've honed my knack for planning, organising, and leading with an open-minded touch. My journey, blending professional work experience and a love for competitive sports, has cultivated a strategic, critical, and problem-solving mindset.

Currently, I'm exploring the realms of React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Tailwind, utilising an Agile Methodology approach, TDD practice, and always keeping an eye on the latest advancements.

Excited to embark on this journey and I'm eager to share and gain knowledge together!
