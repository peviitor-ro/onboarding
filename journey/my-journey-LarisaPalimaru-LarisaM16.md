 
 ## Hello, Beautiful People!


 #### I am happy to be in this beautiful community, where I discovered dedicated people willing to share their work experience. After completing a QA Automation and Manual Testing course, I continued to develop and improve my acquired skills, being always open to learning, taking small steps towards a professional reconversion. My objective is to put into practice the knowledge gained through my involvement in various projects. I started by being part of the testing team, where I managed to understand the BUG Tracking process and work in GITHub, SOLR and Visual Studio Code. With the guidance of Adriana and Andrei mentors, I had the courage to accept new challenges, being able to do my first scrapings. I want to deepen my python, selenium and scraping process.
 
 
 ### I'm waiting for new challenges!
