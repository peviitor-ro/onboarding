Onboarding :
Ma numesc Dragoi Diana, ca si profesie mi-as dori pe viitor sa lucrez in domeniul testarii (sa pornesc de la manual si pe parcurs sa invat si testarea automata).
Am auzit de voi cautand pe google "voluntariat testare " si am zis sa incerc si eu pentru a-mi face experienta pe testare si a o invata cat mai bine.

I learned already :
- to fork a repository of somebody else of mine
- to write an issue
- to make a .md file and to edit it
- to clone a repository to Github desktop
- to give stars to others 

Task 9 - what I have learned after I saw the movie about how a search engine works : 

  A search engine organize all the information worldwide and helps us quickly find whatever we are searching for on the internet. 
  This engine is a big piece of software which takes the word you type and looks for it on the worldwide web  (this software lives on a server rack and helps ranking those pages depending on : where you live,  whether the page was updated recently, how many times the word appears on the page etc.); first it downloads a copy of the entire web, scans it and make a list of all the words and lists of all the pages each word appears. . It does this in one second, billion of times a day every day. It takes millions of servers and hard drives to be able to support the world's websites. 
  Behind this engine there are a lot of engineers and a big team from all over the world. These are using a lot of mathematics and algorithms. They are striving to develop every day this whole process and to correct the mistakes they encounter (like spam pages, misinformations, bad autocomplete, pages that use AI generated nonsense text, hidden keywords and hijacked URL etc). 
  They need to improve the process to stay up to date to the world's changes and they've done this through more ways : natural language processing,  bidirectional encoder representation from transformers, deep ranking etc  to make google search more intuitive. 
  They also made a lot of tests- each failure requires a new test, each test requires rewriting big chunks of code.
  And all of this search engine is free for us, thank to the ads which keep search universally accesible.
