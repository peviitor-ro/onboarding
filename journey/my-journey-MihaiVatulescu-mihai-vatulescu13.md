 Hello, my name is Mihai Vatulescu and I'm a frontend developer that is passionate to learn and practice the concepts into a real project from idea to the     implementation.
 My knowledge is about Angular framework, RxJs library, and HTML/CSS/Javascript, NPM and Node.js of course :).
 I also have some experience with React library but now I do some refresh over those concepts that I forgot during the time since I didn't worked with that library.
 I want to contribute on this project to learn and help others when needed by sharing my knowledge across the team.
 I want also bring some ideas about some refactoring/updates or ideas that may simplify the project workflow.
