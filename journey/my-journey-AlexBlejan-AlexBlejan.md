Hey! 
My name is Alex and I am a Web Developer. Well... actually... I'm not... but I will be. 
I started out by being in love with informatics in highschool, but then I broke up with it. 
While my friends went work in IT, I wanted to work with people... but now I don't share this desire anymore. 
Let me make myself clear: I love working with people. I did it for 10 years and I lead teams of aroun 2000 people, but after 10 years in HR, 
Financial, Facility and Procurement I rediscovered my love for IT. So now I'm busting my ass off to learn to be a Web Developer. 
Currently, I'm attending a Fullstack course from IT Factory and on the side I'm learning from different platforms and I try to develop my coding skills. 
My plan for the next weeks is to learn React and after that we'll see.
