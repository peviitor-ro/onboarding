Hello there!

I'm Robert, I started out as a student at the National College of Computer Science high school, then fell in love with acting and basically became an actor, acted on some big stages in Bucharest and in a lot of plays for children, all while holding 9-5 jobs for some basic income. I still act and work on stand up comedy routines, all this while working on my professional reconversion to web development, making a full circle back to the high school days.
