Hi, I'm Robert aka @porobertdev, a self-taught developer. All my social links are [here](https://links.porobertdev.com). I tweet regularly.

Here's a little story about me.

The first time I have touched programming was at high school, where I've learned some C++ (spoiler: I don't remember much). I liked it, but I was wasting most of my time playing stupid games instead of studying, so I remember that I was left behind when I got to learning about the backtracking algorithm.

Over the years:

- **I tried to get back into programming** with Python for like 3 times through *automatetheboringstuff* and *Python MOOC* courses, but I always gave up too fast because of the impostor syndrome and I procrastinated.
- **I have worked on two Android phones**. Basically, building & porting the popular [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) - a different Open Source flavour of Android, that I shared with the xda-developers community. I worked with git, android tools, and even Hex Ray's IDA to reverse-engineer pre-compiled blobs. Lots of debugging, *aha*-moments and I *hate*-moments. I provided support and updates with changelogs, and I got a few small donations in exchange. The most notable and hard work I did can be seen [here](https://xdaforums.com/f/huawei-nova-nova-plus-roms-kernels-recoveries.5820/) - all posts by *#Henkate* (my old username), like [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-7-1-2-unofficial-lineageos-14-1-25-05-2018.3704606/) or [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-8-1-0-ota-unofficial-lineageos-15-1-15-11-2018.3838338/). And here's my old [https://github.com/skinzor](https://github.com/skinzor). I can prove ownership anytime.
- always tried to automate different stuff with Tasker app on Android, which uses some basic programming concepts.
- did distrohopping, and at some point I could say `I use Arch btw`

**In April 2023**, I was feeling tired of my job (warehouse worker, still going on at this moment) and I took the decision to try programming again. Why? Because nothing else interests me at all and I have always been tech-savy.
I didn't want to start with Python once again. So I did a lil bit of research and started with Web & JavaScript this time through **The Odin Project** course.

So here I am. Still going on and I'm not going to stop this time.

I currently have knowledge about both, Frontend and Backend. It might be too early to say, but I think I enjoy more the backend side.

I didn't create any mind-blowing projects yet, but my first **full-stack apps** that I built recently are:

1. [Mini MessageBoard](https://secret-ruthanne-porobertdev-614629eb.koyeb.app/) - a live-chat app using the WebSocket protocol, featuring a simple admin dashboard by authenticating using PassportJS and a session.
2. [HashCode](https://hashcode.porobert.dev/) - a Pastebin alternative, where I've focused on the API REST design and implementing some security features.

My current **interests**:

- Scraping
- Arduino/ESP32
- AI/ML
- Mobile apps
- Chrome/GNOME/VSCode Extensions
- indiehacking, thus, design & marketing too.

And my current **tech-stack**:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- AstroJS
- NodeJS & ExpressJS
- Jest
- SQL / PostgreSQL

[I know some DSA too](https://github.com/porobertdev/dsa-solutions), but right now I'd need to recap a bit.

I have some experience with scraping:

1. When I've used Python, I've built a **manga scraper** for a friend.
2. And with JavaScript, I built a **Youtube scraper** that fetches N search results with all info such as title, thumbnail, likes, comments, and also channel info. I've used **Puppeteer** since I couldn't find another way at that time (considering the website is server-side rendered), and had to implement an auto-scroller. It looks like it still works right now: ![Terminal showcasing Youtube Scraper logs](https://i.imgur.com/O5MfdEk.png)

Now that I know some backend, I plan to re-create it and find a way to make it much faster, and also create a frontend.

Btw, there's an Open Source scraping framework that I found very interesting: https://crawlee.dev/

## Goal

That being said, I'm here to experiment different things, gain more experience and build connections.

## Update for `tasks`

- [X] task_0000010_What_Is_A_Search_Engine - Capture in your JOURNEY what you have learned after you saw the movie.
  A search engine is a crawler - a software that finds URLs on the web which matches the search query.

  Google's mission is to organize that information and make it accessible. The Google Search Engine uses an indexing and ranking algorithm to sort and filter the results based on different metrics (such as quality and authoritativeness). The two main challenges they are facing is teaching the (dumb) computer to understand human's language better in order to get more accurate results, and dealing with spam.

  Essentially, It's like having a database full of website links which are labeled, and Google extracts the ones matching the query keyword(s) into an array that then gets displayed.
