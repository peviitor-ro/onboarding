I am just finishing Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and looking forward to land my first job or internship. Of course, until then I am trying to work as a volunteer for different organization and this is my first one.

I will contribute to this project with scraping data with python and delivering it into the main system.

My main languages are Python, Java and TypeScript. I also worked with SQL databases such as PostgreSQL and non-relational databases (redis) for cache systems.
